# get-uptobox-subs

***If the uptobox link has no uptostream link or the video is hardsubbed, it does not work!***

Get subs from an uptobox link:

- Install the script `get-wakanim-subs.js` in your best userscript manager like [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- Open an uptobox link
- A new button should appear to get subs. If the button does not appear, refresh the page.

To know:
- Optimized for French videos...
- If a video contains multi subs, only the 1st subtitle will be downloaded.


# Disclaimer
This method of use is very simple to find. I should be not really responsable of a bad use.
